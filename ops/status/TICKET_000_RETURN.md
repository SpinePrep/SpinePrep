**Commit:**
```
f7295a5f feat(ops): repository status snapshot and merge plan  [spi-000]

Generate comprehensive pre-Phase-A repository audit with:
- repo_status.json: machine-readable branch/health/divergence inventory
- merge_plan.md: step-by-step consolidation strategy for 12 branches
- repo_risks.md: risk assessment with conflict zones and mitigations
- health_check.sh: executable script for repeatable health validation

Findings:
- 12 local branches (2 already merged, 10 active/stale)
- feat/spi-A1-doctor-json-snapshot is most complete (6 commits ahead)
- Test suite broken (confounds import error)
- Large tracked files (.venv 100MB+, site/ 5MB+) need cleanup
- Pytest failing, snakefmt needs 1 file, ruff clean

Next: Ticket 1 will execute merge_plan.md with rollback tag.
```

**Push:** ✅ Success

**Title:** spi-000: Repository status snapshot and merge plan

**Status:** Open, awaiting review

## [NOTES]

### Key Findings

**Branch Inventory:**
- 12 local branches (2 already merged, 10 active/diverged)
- `feat/spi-A1-doctor-json-snapshot` is most complete (6 commits, includes doctor, QC, confounds, registration, masking)
- `feat/spi-002-snakemake-dag-provenance` may have unique DAG export code
- 3 branches share identical SHA (81712fac) — duplicates to archive

**Critical Risks (🔴):**
1. **R1 - Test suite broken:** confounds import error (blocker to validation)
2. **R2 - CLI merge conflicts:** 4+ branches modify `spineprep/cli.py`
3. **R3 - Large tracked files:** .venv (100MB+), site/ (5MB+), __pycache__

**Medium Risks (🟡):**
4. **R4 - Confounds module structure drift:** Different __init__.py exports across branches
5. **R5 - Version string conflicts:** 5 branches bump `_version.py` independently
10. **R10 - Missing DAG code:** spi-002 may have unique Snakemake DAG work

**Health Status:**
- ✅ Ruff: clean
- ✅ MkDocs: strict build passes
- ⚠️  Snakefmt: 1 file needs formatting
- ❌ Pytest: 1 import error (confounds)
- ❌ Codespell: 1202 false positives (site/ minified JS)

**Bloat Detected:**
- `.venv/` tracked (100MB+ of Python packages)
- `site/` tracked (5MB+ of generated docs)
- `__pycache__/` tracked throughout
- `.snakemake/log/` untracked clutter

### Recommended Action Sequence for Ticket 1

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
1. Update `.gitignore` to block .venv, site/, __pycache__, .snakemake/, *.egg-info
2. Remove from tracking: `git rm -r --cached .venv/ site/ **/__pycache__/ **/*.egg-info/`
3. Tag rollback point: `git tag pre-phaseA-20251009 && git push origin pre-phaseA-20251009`

**Phase 2 (Merge):**
4. Use `feat/spi-A1-doctor-json-snapshot` as primary merge source (most complete)
5. Cherry-pick unique commits from `feat/spi-002` if DAG code missing in A1
6. Archive duplicate branches (spi-masking, spi-xxx-registration, spi-a7)
7. Delete already-merged branches (spi-001, doctor-environment-diagnostics)

**Phase 3 (Validation):**
8. Fix confounds test imports: update `tests/test_confounds.py` to match new structure
9. Run `snakefmt .` to fix 1 file
10. Verify all health checks green (or document known failures)

**Rollback if:**
- More than 5 test files break
- CLI commands entirely missing
- Merge conflicts take >2 hours
- Main branch becomes unbuildable

### Follow-up Tickets

After Ticket 1 (merge execution), create:

**Ticket 2 (Tree hygiene & CI bootstrap):**
- Enforce pre-commit hooks (ruff, snakefmt, codespell)
- Pin Python/SCT versions, freeze lockfiles
- Add smoke test workflow asserting repo health

**Ticket 3 (Gate review):**
- Verify all Phase-A prerequisites met
- Update README with current scope and Phase A goals
- Confirm ready to start A1 (CLI skeleton & doctor) from TODO_A.md

### Technical Debt

- Force-push to clean git history (requires CEO approval, coordination)
- Add branch protection on main (require PR, CI pass)
- Add mypy type checking to CI
- Document branching strategy in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Create .codespellrc to skip site/ and minified files

### Risks Accepted

- **Codespell false positives:** Site/ generated files will be removed in Ticket 1, resolving this
- **Test import error:** Will be fixed post-merge in Ticket 1 (not blocking to merge itself)
- **Diverged branches:** Intentional; consolidation is the goal of Ticket 1

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `ops/status/repo_status.json` exists and is valid JSON
- [x] `ops/status/merge_plan.md` lists all branches with clear actions and exact git commands
- [x] `ops/status/repo_risks.md` identifies 10 risks with severity scoring and mitigations
- [x] `ops/status/health_check.sh` is executable and runs successfully
- [x] All command outputs captured in ops/status/*.txt files
- [x] Branch/commit/push/PR completed per workflow
- [x] Zero code changes (read-only audit)

---

## Summary

Ticket 0 successfully delivered a comprehensive repository audit with actionable merge plan. Repository health is FAIR with 2 critical blockers identified (test imports, tracked bloat). The merge plan provides step-by-step instructions to consolidate 12 branches into main, with `feat/spi-A1-doctor-json-snapshot` as the primary source. Rollback strategy in place. Ready for Ticket 1 execution.

**Confidence:** 🟢 HIGH — All deliverables complete, risks documented, rollback planned.

**Next:** CEO to review and approve Ticket 1 (merge execution).
