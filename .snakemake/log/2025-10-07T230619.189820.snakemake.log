    * Mixed rules and functions in same snakefile.:
      Small one-liner functions used only once should be defined as lambda
      expressions. Other functions should be collected in a common module, e.g.
      'rules/common.smk'. This makes the workflow steps more readable.

      In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.

      does not involve boilerplate. Similar to run, you will have direct access
      to params, input, output, and wildcards.Only use the run directive for a
      handful of lines.
