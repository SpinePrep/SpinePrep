# SpinePrep rules for Cursor
- Always output ONLY the files requested.
- For each file, print a header line: === <relative path> ===
- After each header, print ONE fenced code block with FULL file contents.
- No extra narration or commentary.
- Prefer idempotent scripts (bash: set -euo pipefail).
- Do not include secrets; read tokens from environment variables.
