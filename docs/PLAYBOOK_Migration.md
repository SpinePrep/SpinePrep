I am migrating to a new conversation. You are the current architect for a project to design a robust preprocessing pipeline like fMRIPrep, but for spinal cord fMRI (working name: SpinePrep). Please produce one self-contained handoff message so a new assistant can continue without any prior context.

What I need from you:

Capture the projectâ€™s purpose and scope, the current state, and the most important decisions so far with brief rationales.

Summarize the overall design, major components, key dependencies, and how things fit together.

List the main risks, open questions, and immediate next actions as small execution-ready tickets.

Provide only what is necessary for a seamless handoff, written concisely, with no follow-up questions.

Constraints:

Single message, no external references required to understand it.

Be accurate, concise, actionable, and self-contained.

Output now.
